The KION Group, which is included in the MDAX, is the largest manufacturer of industrial trucks in Europe in terms of units sold in 2021.
With more than 1.6 million industrial trucks and over 8,000 systems installed worldwide as at  December 31, 2021, the KION Group counts companies of various sizes in numerous industries on six continents among its customers.
In his 14 years at the Company, he transformed it from a truck manufacturer focused on Europe to a leading global provider of intralogistics solutions with tremendous prospects for the future.
Adjusted EBIT was also higher than in 2020, increasing by 53.9 percent to €841.8 million.
Net income amounted to €568.0 million, more than double compared to the year 2020.
For the new business in the industrial trucks market, we expect a decline in 2022 in the single-digit percentage range following the very strong year 2021 and thus below the long-term growth trend of around 4 percent.
Capital expenditure on this future-focused project is expected to amount to approximately €140 million.
The Group invests a total of around €80 million in the new plant.
At its meeting on March 2, 2022, the Supervisory Board also discussed and approved the proposal made by the Executive Board that the distributable profit of KION GROUP AG be appropriated for the payment of a dividend of €1.50 per no-par-value share.
For the first time, KION shares broke through the €100 barrier and reached their highest ever price in the Company’s history of €103.70 on November 16, 2021.
The shares closed at €96.48 on December 30, 2021.
Based on around 131.1 million shares outstanding, this equates to market capitalization of €12.6 billion, of which approximately €6.9 billion was attributable to shares in free float.
This included the distribution of a dividend of €0.41 per share.
With earnings per share for 2020 of €1.81, this equates to a dividend payout rate of around 25 percent.
This gives a total dividend payout of €196.7 million.
With earnings per share for 2021 of €4.34, this equates to a dividend payout rate of around 35 percent.

The new KION ITS EMEA Operating Unit, which was formed on January 1, 2021 from the previously separate LMH EMEA and STILL EMEA Operating Units, focuses on the ITS business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
Measured in terms of units sold in 2021, KION continues to be the number one in the European market for industrial trucks.
The medium-term target is consolidated revenue of over €12 billion in 2023, to which the Industrial Trucks & Services is to contribute more than €7.5 billion and the Supply Chain Solutions segment more than €4.5 billion.
Incorporating a climate-regulated high-bay storage facility and a clothes hanging system that can accommodate up to two million garments and transport up to 15,000 totes to the picking stations per hour, this is the biggest warehouse that Dematic has installed so far.
The eurozone exceeded this figure, with growth of 5.2 percent, but remained below its pre-crisis level from 2019.
In the EMEA region (western Europe, eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa), new orders rose by 53.4 percent compared with the (albeit severely impacted) figure for the prior year.
On average, the euro appreciated against the US dollar in 2021 (up by 3.6 percent), which weakened the export business.
In October, KION GROUP AG entered into an agreement for a new syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with a total volume of €1,000.0 million.
The planned level of capital spending will be just under €40 million.
The purchase consideration for 79.0 percent of the shares totaled €13.9 million.
The KION Group’s order intake amounted to a record €12,481.6 million, which was 32.2 percent higher than the figure for the previous year (2020: €9,442.5 million).
As at the end of 2021, the Group’s order book had grown to a record €6,658.5 million.
Consolidated revenue increased by 23.4 percent to €10,294.3 million (2020: €8,341.6 million).
Basic earnings per share rose to €4.34 (2020: €1.81) based on an average number of 131.1 million (2020: 118.9 million) no-par-value shares.
KION GROUP AG will propose a dividend of €1.50 per share to the 2022 Annual General Meeting (2020: €0.41).
Net financial debt fell to €567.6 million (December 31, 2020: €880.0 million).
The KION Group’s order intake of €12,481.6 million was higher than the target range of €10,650 million to €11,450 million.
At €10,294.3 million, consolidated revenue was near the upper end of the target range of €9,700 million to €10,300 million.
Free cash flow reached €543.8 million with a target range of €450 million to €550 million.
Order intake in the Industrial Trucks & Services segment amounted to €8,166.3 million, which was substantially higher than the target range of €6,850 million to €7,250 million.

Adjusted EBIT amounted to €409.5 million, which was within the target range of €385 million to €425 million.
Much of this rise was attributable to the Industrial Trucks & Services segment, where order intake jumped by 40.9 percent to €8,166.3 million (2020: €5,796.8 million) due to high demand from customers for new trucks and services.
In the Supply Chain Solutions segment, order intake went up by 18.5 percent to €4,329.4 million (2020: €3,654.5 million).
Currency effects had a modest impact on the value of the KION Group’s order intake, reducing it by €53.1 million.
Revenue Consolidated revenue increased by 23.4 percent to €10,294.3 million in 2021 (2020: €8,341.6 million).

In the Supply Chain Solutions segment, revenue from external customers increased by 44.3 percent to €3,780.3 million (2020: €2,619.4 million).
In addition to the high volume of orders in the project business (business solutions), this was because the segment worked through big-ticket orders for warehouse automation that had been placed in North America and Europe in 2020.
The figure for 2020 of €389.9 million had been heavily impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
EBIT for 2021 included a good level of positive non-recurring items, which amounted to income of €37.8 million (2020: expense of €65.1 million).
The prior-year figure had mainly included components of the capacity and structural program (expense of €45.8 million) and impairment losses on non-current assets.
The very satisfying level of orders on hand enabled the KION Group to adjust the capacity program and reverse excess provision; taking account of the ongoing program costs, there were positive non-recurring items amounting to income of €8.2 million.
At the same time, purchase price allocation effects declined slightly to an expense of €84.8 million (2020: €91.9 million).
The Group’s EBITDA adjusted for the positive non-recurring items (adjusted EBITDA) amounted to €1,696.9 million (2020: €1,383.5 million), giving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.5 percent (2020: 16.6 percent).
Key influencing factors for earnings The cost of sales rose at a similar rate to revenue, increasing by 23.4 percent to €7,770.7 million (2020: €6,296.8 million).
Net financial expenses The net financial expenses, representing the balance of financial income and financial expenses, improved to €35.1 million (2020: €88.3 million).

The total number of new trucks ordered rose by 51.0 percent to 299.4 thousand (2020: 198.3 thousand), driven by pent-up demand from previous years and orders brought forward.
Currency effects had only a marginal negative impact on order intake, reducing it by a total of €8.6 million.
Currency effects had a minimal impact on segment revenue, increasing it by €5.5 million.
The non-recurring items, which amounted to total income of €26.3 million and were recognized in functional costs, largely related to positive effects of plan adjustments affecting defined benefit obligations and the partial reversal of excess provisions for the capacity program.
The prior-year figure, an expense of €44.9 million, had included adverse effects on earnings from the capacity and structural program as well as an impairment charge on an equity investment.
After taking into account non-recurring items and purchase price allocation effects, EBIT rose to €560.5 million (2020: €265.6 million).
Adjusted EBITDA increased to €1,297.9 million (2020: €1,054.9 million), giving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9 percent (2020: 18.4 percent).
Currency effects – primarily in relation to the US dollar – reduced order intake by a total of €44.4 million.
Revenue growth was particularly significant in North America and western Europe, mainly because the segment worked through the order book that it had built up in 2020 and maintained a consistently high level of capacity utilization.
Negative currency effects reduced segment revenue by €52.4 million.
Earnings The adjusted EBIT of the Supply Chain Solutions segment amounted to €409.5 million (2020: €277.5 million).
This year-on-year rise of €132.0 million was largely due to the increased volume of business.
Revenue and earnings Total segment revenue, which came to €168.0 million (2020: €157.3 million), again mainly resulted from internal IT services.
The segment’s EBIT came to €292.3 million (2020: €113.0 million).
This included positive non-recurring items amounting to income of €18.1 million (2020: expense of €9.8 million) that arose primarily in connection with the intra-group allocation of costs of KION GROUP AG to the subsidiaries in the ITS and SCS segments.
As a result, adjusted EBIT for the segment came to €274.2 million (2020: €122.7 million).
Excluding intra-group income from equity investments in the Corporate Services segment, adjusted EBIT was minus €103.4 million (2020: minus €41.7 million).
Adjusted EBITDA stood at €300.2 million (2020: €152.3 million), or minus €77.3 million (2020: minus €12.3 million) if intra-group income from equity investments is excluded.
The carrying amount of intangible assets rose to €5,710.7 million (December 31, 2020: €5,559.6 million).
Of this sum, €3,544.8 million was attributable to goodwill (December 31, 2020: €3,407.6 million).
Exchange rate movements accounted for €130.0 million of this increase.
In addition, the acquisition of the remaining shares in German wholesaler and service provider Hans Joachim Jetschke Industriefahrzeuge (GmbH & Co.) KG and JETSCHKE GmbH resulted in goodwill of €7.1 million.
Other property, plant, and equipment rose to €1,447.5 million (December 31, 2020: €1,316.6 million), primarily due to increased capital expenditure on modernization and site expansion.
Right-of-use assets related to procurement leases were up moderately year on year, standing at €513.6 million as at the end of 2021 (December 31, 2020: €492.5 million).
Of this figure, €401.6 million was attributable to land and buildings (December 31, 2020: €375.0 million) and €112.0 million to plant & machinery and office furniture & equipment (December 31, 2020: €117.5 million).
The rental assets from the short-term rental business recognized in the statement of financial position came to €542.8 million as at the reporting date (December 31, 2020: €529.6 million).

There was a sharp rise in cash and cash equivalents to €483.0 million (December 31, 2020: €314.4 million), reflecting the improvement in free cash flow.
A variable-rate tranche of the promissory note, that had a nominal amount of €167.0 million and was due to mature in 2024, was repaid ahead of schedule at the end of April 2021, thereby contributing to a further decrease in leverage.
KION GROUP AG entered into an agreement for a new syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with a total volume of €1,000.0 million on October 4, 2021.
Analysis of capital structure Non-current and current liabilities amounted to €10,682.0 million as at December 31, 2021, which was €897.2 million higher than the figure as at December 31, 2020 of €9,784.8 million.

Financial debt Non-current and current financial liabilities totaled €1,050.5 million (December 31, 2020: €1,194.5 million).
Non-current financial liabilities fell to €898.7 million (December 31, 2020: €1,117.4 million), primarily because of the repayment of a variable-rate tranche of the promissory note with a nominal amount of €167.0 million in April 2021.
As a result of this repayment, the carrying amount of non-current promissory notes stood at only €326.1 million as at the end of 2021 (December 31, 2020: €590.0 million).
Current financial liabilities rose to €151.9 million as at the end of 2021 (December 31, 2020: €77.1 million).
This included the fixed-rate tranche of the promissory note maturing in May 2022, which has a nominal amount of €92.5 million and is now recognized under current financial liabilities, having been reported as non-current at the end of 2020.
The unused portion of the RCF therefore stood at €1,000.0 million (December 31, 2020: €1,150.0 million).
This was largely owing to higher discount rates and to plan adjustments of €32.7 million recognized in profit or loss.
The net obligation under defined benefit pension plans decreased year on year to €1,185.6 million (December 31, 2020: €1,400.0 million).

The currency translation gains of €234.5 million, also recognized in other comprehensive income, had a substantial positive impact on equity too.
KION GROUP AG’s dividend payout in May 2021 reduced equity by €53.7 million.
Cash and cash equivalents increased to €483.0 million as at the reporting date (December 31, 2020: €314.4 million) thanks to the healthy increase in free cash flow.
On October 4, 2021, KION GROUP AG entered into an agreement for a new syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with a reduced total volume of €1,000.0 million.
The previous credit facility, which had a volume of €1,150.0 million, was terminated at the same time.
